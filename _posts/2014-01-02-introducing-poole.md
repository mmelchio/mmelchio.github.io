Poole is the butler for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the static site generator. It's used by [@m_melchio](https://twitter.com/m_melchio).

Current website:

* [mmelchio](http://mmelchio.github.io)

### What's included

Poole is a streamlined Jekyll site designed and built as a foundation for building more meaningful themes. Poole, and every theme built on it, includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404.html), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

Additional features are available in individual themes.

### Browser support

Poole and it's themes are by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Poole is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/poole">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
